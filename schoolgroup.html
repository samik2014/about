				<h3 class="text-center">Our Story</h3>
				<p>School Group was founded in 2018, in Texas, USA by Bimal Kumar, a graduate with an Aerospace Engineering from the University of Texas. In his earlier years, as a youth of the country of Nepal, Mr. Kumar had experienced the difficulties of having access to quality learning. He walked for an hour each day just to go to a school that lacked textbooks, had no library and trying hard to remain positive with such a monotonous education system. It was not until having the opportunity to go abroad and study in UT, experiencing a school with the latest technology and teaching skills, that he was finally able to witness the big differences in the quality of education between two separate countries. Knowing this, he set out on a journey to more than 30 countries around the world immersing himself in each of their education systems, learning that every countryâ€™s system had their strengths and weaknesses in what they taught.</p>
				<p>Enlightened by all he had discovered, Mr. Kumar was on a mission to integrate the world's schools together to collaborate, utilize the power of his study for the purpose of making learning smarter and make the education of students more meaningful through peer to peer learning.</p>
				<p>All of this is what brought about his idea to create School Group, a non-profit, free learning platform, for the purpose of education and skill development, using the latest A.I. technology so that the global learners can have access to a community of shared knowledge that will expand and continuously improve, bettering the lives for everyone.</p>

				<h3 class="text-center">Our Purpose</h3>
				<h5 class="text-center">Understanding the Obstacles of Traditional eLearning</h5>
				<p>In recent years, eLearning has grown significantly as the latest development in education. Despite the progress, many obstacles still exist with this technological and philosophical improvement to the traditional classroom. Traditionally, eLearning platforms operate in a one-to-one virtual classroom that isolates learners from their peers. Computer literacy, technical issues, adaptability, self-motivation, and time management are just a few of the issues that traditional eLearning faces.</p>
